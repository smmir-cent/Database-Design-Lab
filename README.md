# Database Design Lab

Hi! This repository is related to Database Design Lab homework at Amirkabir University.
This project will include at least 10 series of homework.
We will also work with **postgresql** and **MongoDB** databases.
The cpp language has been selected for the exercises. **pqxx**, which is an api, allows us to connect to postgresql. The MongoDB C Driver, also known as **libmongoc**, is a library for using MongoDB from C applications, and for writing MongoDB drivers in higher-level languages.


# Installing pqxx

Install libpqxx-dev in Ubuntu 18.04
```
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y libpqxx-dev
```
